# Pre class

1. Start off by drawing on board a diagram of a client, server and database. Explain what portion of the board we will be learning about today. Briefly explain why we are teaching relational databases and sql. 

- Hit on how databases are extremely fast. give personal example.

- We are teaching relational databases vs teaching non-relational databases

- relational databases are great for 
    * data sets that have a predefined structure and relate to each other well

- non-relational databases (MongoDB, Redis) are great for 
    * non-structured data sets that are constanstly changing and don't necessarily relate to each other in any discernable way

* Make sure to point out that the specific dialect of sql we will be learning is postgresql. There are many different dialects so when students are searching google for answers they need to be searching for postgres.

2. Start talking about the different kinds of data and the different ways that humans have stored data in the past. 

* Kinds of data 

- customer information
- facebook post
- medical records
- insurance information
- e.t.c

* Different data stores 

- pen and paper 
- usb drive 
- floppy disk
- hardrive 
- solid state drive

3. Still on white board, draw out diagram of a few tables and explain how database tables are like excel sheets. You have your columns that describe that piece of data and then you have your rows. 

4. Lastly, draw out diagram on board of a schema and explain how it's a blueprint for our database. it describes the data that will be stored in it.
